Open NX-OS on the Cisco Nexus platform is a rich software suite built on a Linux foundation that exposes APIs, data models, and programmatic constructs.  Using Application Programmatic Interfaces (APIs) and configuration agents, operators can affect configuration changes in a more programmatic way.  Cisco provides various tools and frameworks to enable developers automate and program Nexus devices, including – NX-API REST (brings Model Driven Programmability (MDP) to standalone, Python, Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc.
