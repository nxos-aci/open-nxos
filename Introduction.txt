Open NX-OS on the Cisco Nexus platform is a rich software suite built on a Linux foundation that exposes APIs, data models, and programmatic constructs.  Using Application Programmatic Interfaces (APIs) and configuration agents, operators can affect configuration changes in a more programmatic way.  Cisco provides various tools and frameworks to enable developers automate and program Nexus devices, including – NX-API REST (brings Model Driven Programmability (MDP) to standalone, Python, Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc.

This section provides basic Open NX-OS configuration use cases, such as – interface config, VLAN config & management, OSPF config etc. Examples are written in most widely used config tools/programmatic interfaces – Puppet, NX-API and Python.
